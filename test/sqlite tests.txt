ITERATION 1
	CREATING SQL
		Test to see if .sql file creates database properly, with 
		schema, data, and stored procedures.
	CREATING STORED PROCEDURES
		Tested calling image.image. Does not work nicely.
		Pushed calling of image.image to its own stored procedure.
		Otherwise, tested the queries in stored procedures to insure validity
		
		Extensive testing especially done on the stored procedure
		"getRecipesWithoutAllergen" to insure that the temporary table
		creates the write "not these recipes", and that the query itself
		actually returns the desired "here's safe recipes".
	MIGRATING OVER TO SQLITE
		Migrated over to Sqlite in order to keep database embedded in 
		the application. Used a nice tool to help translate the MySql
		database over to a sqlite script.
		
		Re-verified Stored Procedure logic will work in sqlite, even 
		if the queries must now be done in the app itself.
